# Physical Game Building Blocks
A collection of pieces/concepts in game design for use by designers, hackers,
or just creative players. take control of your gaming experience!

Part of my hope for this repo is to build a shared vocabulary for folks wanting
to play games together, and especially folks who have fun making up the rules themselves!

Also, Geoffrey Engelstein & Isaac Shalev's book _Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design: An

copyright issues around this, because I'd like to collect and share as much going-wisdom as
possible here.
